// Shared guard for admin-provisioned merchant owner accounts.
//
// Restaurants (food) and stores (shop) are both onboarded the same way: an
// admin creates the owner's auth account, sets its password and grants it the
// merchant role. Both verticals must refuse the same thing — pointing that
// flow at a Smart Mappia STAFF account.
//
// Without this guard, "Assign owner" on an email belonging to an admin would
// upsert role:'merchant' over their profile (demoting them) AND overwrite
// their password: a complete takeover of a colleague's admin account, driven
// from inside the admin portal. Mirrors the signup-side refusal in
// authController (handbook §13.3.4) — admin accounts are provisioned ONLY by
// the seed scripts and the ADMIN_EMAILS allow-list.

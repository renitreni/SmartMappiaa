// MVP fare model:
//   Airport Pick & Drop — flat SAR 100 base, plus a 3.75% service fee,
//   plus a distance surcharge past the free radius, plus 15% KSA VAT.
//
//     base        = SAR 100.00
//     service fee = 3.75% of base = SAR 3.75
//     amount      = SAR 103.75   <- fare snapshot (bookings.fare_amount)
//     surcharge   = SAR   1.25   <- e.g. a 20 km trip (bookings.distance_surcharge)
//     VAT (15%)   = SAR  15.75
//     totalAmount = SAR 120.75   <- what the passenger pays
//
// `amount` is the EX-VAT fare and stays the commission base: lib/ledger.js
// computeLedger() splits it between driver and platform. VAT is the
// platform's liability to the tax authority, so it is tracked separately
// (bookings.vat_amount / total_amount, migration 0025) and never enters
// the driver's cut.
//
// THE SURCHARGE IS DELIBERATELY OUTSIDE `amount`, FOR THE SAME REASON.
// It is platform revenue, and computeLedger() pays the driver a share of
// whatever fare_amount holds — folding the surcharge in there would hand
// roughly 80% of it straight to the rider, which is the opposite of the
// intent. It sits beside VAT: inside totalAmount, outside the commission
// base. The service fee is charged on the base only, not on the surcharge.
//
// Rides have NO distance cap. A long airport transfer is legitimate, and
// exceedsMaxRadius() is a delivery rule — see lib/deliveryPricing.js.
//
// Every figure is stored as a SNAPSHOT on the booking and never
// recalculated after the passenger submits, keeping the agreed price fixed.

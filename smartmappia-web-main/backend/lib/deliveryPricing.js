//
// One module rather than three copies because foodMoney and shopMoney are
// already written to mirror each other line for line, and rides now join
// them. Three copies of a money rule is three places for it to drift.
//
// WHO KEEPS IT: on rides, the platform — and that is NOT automatic, the
// surcharge must stay outside bookings.fare_amount; see lib/fare.js for why.
// On food and shop the surcharge is folded into delivery_fee and is split
// with the driver along with the rest of it (driverShareOf below): they drove
// the extra kilometres.
//
// Pure functions, no I/O. `distanceKm` is null whenever either endpoint
// has no coordinates, and a null distance always means NO surcharge —
// never a guess, and never a rejection.
